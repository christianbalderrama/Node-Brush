Background:
This personal repository shows my journey about learning Node in a deeper level. When I started my career in the industry, though we're using node, it was not as I thought it'll be used. Most of the time it was just used to create an http server and endpoints, that's it. But as I progress in my career I realized that I really knew nothing about it and makes me insecure about other software engineers that has a really deep understanding about Node which is why this repository is created.

Why the repository is called `Node-Brush`? It's because I wanted to brush up my knowledge about Node.

Who should use this?
- People that are interested in learning Node from scratch.
- People that have a basic/intermediate programming experience and have ideas about OOP (Object Oriented Programming)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming]
- People that have a basic understanding about Node and want to dig deeper.

The official documentation of Node can be found here[https://nodejs.org/en/docs/] and the people in the Node community have done a tremendous job in providing examples, illustrations, explanations and I cannot give more props to them. This repository is just an extension of the official docs but with additions and more comprehensive explanations on how things really work.

How to use it:
The way you should use this repository should be running through the folders I have created and I have provided a list below in chronological order on how you should learn Node based from my experience.
